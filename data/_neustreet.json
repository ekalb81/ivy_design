    "problem": {
        "top": "Neustreet is undergoing a strategic shift in its business model, narrowing its focus to specialize in distributing sneaker data to corporate clients. This move marks a departure from its previous model, which encompassed data for various collectibles targeting a broader audience. As part of this transition, Neustreet aims to introduce an intuitive API page tailored for developers and a Data Insights page that presents the data in a more digestible format for clients, particularly those on sales teams within the corporate sphere.",
        "bottom": "Recognizing the need for improvement, Neustreet acknowledges that its current website suffers from confusing navigation. To align with its new direction, the company intends to downplay the media-centric features of the site, such as articles and newsletters, in favor of prioritizing data insights and the API. Moreover, Neustreet acknowledges that the website's imagery and overall branding lack coherence, expressing a desire for a more unified and representative online presence."
