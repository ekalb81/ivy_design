    <p>To recap, I tested users on three different red routes for the gardening app during the user interviews. I wanted
        to make sure the flows made sense to users and were intuitive. The goal was to eliminate as many pain points as
        possible.</p>
    <ol style="align-self: flex-start">
        <li>Save an item to their favorites and access the favorites page.</li>
        <li>Add a comment to a post in the community forums.</li>
        <li>Add an item to the calendar.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I conducted these tests in person and online via Zoom. I began by introducing myself and asking the users some
        preliminary questions to get them comfortable. I helped them become familiar with the dashboard of the app and
        told them about our goals. I proceeded to give them the tasks while encouraging them to think out loud. Two
        rounds of user testing were conducted. The first round had 4 participants and the second round had 5
        participants. </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 5%">These are some of the most common pain points that occurred during the first round of
        user tests. I brainstormed
        and implemented solutions into the prototype and did a second round of user tests. </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Problem</span> The floating action button on the dashboard was a particularly
        obvious pain point. Several users would click it first when attempting to do the first task, which was not the
        correct course of action. </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 5%;"><span style="font-weight:bold">Solution</span> The floating action button on the
        dashboard was removed, and the
        task boxes that it was initially
        associated with gained their own buttons to perform the same function. </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Problem</span> The speech bubble icon that indicated the number of replies on a
        post within a forum was initially not clickable, as it was just meant to indicate how many people had interacted
        with a specific post. Several users attempted to click it in order to perform the second task.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 5%;"><span style="font-weight:bold">Solution</span> I made the speech bubble icon on posts
        clickable so that it would
        lead the user to the same page that
        clicking the rest of the preview image would.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Problem</span> Pop-up boxes had to be manually dismissed by users. This was
        cumbersome during the tests and it would abrupt their flow when performing the given tasks.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 5%;"><span style="font-weight:bold">Solution</span> I made the pop-up boxes automatically
        dismiss themselves after a short period of time</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Problem</span> It was unclear to some users that the bookmark button next to the
        plant images in that plant profile page was meant to save it to their save library. </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 2%;"><span style="font-weight:bold">Solution</span> I labeled the bookmark button in order
        to make the functionality
        clear, so there was no guesswork on the user’s end.</p>
