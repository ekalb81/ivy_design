    <p style="margin-bottom: 2%;">After presenting the low-fidelity prototype to the team, I began the high-fidelity
        prototype. This was initially done while keeping placeholders in mind. The brand identity was developed
        alongside the prototype throughout multiple meetings. The prototype went through several iterations which were
        all reviewed by the company. </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 5%;">A major point of contention was using pop-ups as a point of contact versus a contact
        page. I made two versions of the website in Figma that used both of these concepts and argued against the use of
        pop-ups because of their capacity to frustrate users, especially on mobile devices. The team ultimately agreed,
        and we went ahead with a contact page. This was rushed into development and skipped the low-fidelity step.
        Despite this, I think the design was successful.

    <p>The rest of the website underwent the typical design structure. For the homepage, a separate media row was added
        for podcasts because this is a tactic that Neustreet uses for onboarding potential customers. They wanted to
        highlight the newest podcasts on the front page, but it would all be organized under a separate media page. </p>

    <p>As mentioned in the beginning, the API page was removed so this no longer necessitated the use of a Data sample
        on the homepage. This allowed us to further emphasize the Data Insights page. A Contact Us CTA was added to the
        top right corner of all the desktop pages for ease of access. </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 5%;">The images were generated using the Midjourney AI generator. Because this is a small
        start-up, they are unable to
        currently allocate funds for individual illustrations for every page.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 1.25em; align-self: center">Desktop Data Insights Page</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 5%;">The insights page got fleshed out and we decided on an AI-generated image of a shoe
        made up of data and
        technology. Graphs were hand-curated from our data to give potential customers an idea of what information they
        could purchase from us. These graphs can be clicked on and expanded in a separate window. </p>
