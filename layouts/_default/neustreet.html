    <p class="section-header">Business Goals</p>
    <p>Neustreet would like to refocus its product and become a sneaker data-centric company. They aim to sell their
        product to high-level corporations (i.e. Nike, Adidas, etc.) for a monthly fee. Their clientele may be small at
        first, but they aim to have a small number of large clients rather than a large number of small clients. They
        are, for the moment, moving away from a generalization of collectibles to focus solely on sneaker collectibles
        and marketplaces. The website will be their point of contact and it should be streamlined, functional, and
        reflect their brand and product.  </p>
